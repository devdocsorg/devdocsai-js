# Example with Docusaurus swizzled search plugin

This example shows you how to use DevDocs.ai in
[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) while using another theme search plugin,
such as
[theme-search-algolia](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/themes/@docusaurus/theme-search-algolia).

## Installation

```
$ npm install
```

## Local development

```
$ npm start
```

This command starts a local development server. Most changes are reflected live
without having to restart the server.

## Notes

If you don't have an existing search plugin installed in your Docusaurus
project, you can use the DevDocs.ai Docusaurus plugin without swizzling. Please
refer to the
[Docusaurus example](https://github.com/devdocsorg/devdocsai-js/tree/main/examples/with-docusaurus)
for a simpler configuration-based setup using the
`@devdocsai/docusaurus-theme-search` plugin.
